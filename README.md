## Project Scope

The core objective of this project is to develop and evaluate deep learning models for detecting anomalous user behaviors within sequential authentication event data.  
This is a critical component for modern cybersecurity frameworks, aiming to:

- Identify suspicious activities that traditional rule-based systems might miss.
- Safeguard enterprise networks from unauthorized access, data breaches, and advanced persistent threats.

The project involves:

- Analyzing sequences of authentication events to learn patterns of normal user behavior.
- Flagging deviations that indicate malicious activities.
- Leveraging sequence modeling, temporal analysis, and attention mechanisms to handle the complexity of real-world cybersecurity data.
- Utilizing the **Comprehensive, Multi-Source Cyber-Security Events Dataset** from the **Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)** enterprise network for practical relevance and scalability.
